These codes is programmed in MATLAB, is it design to understand data analysis in modern astronomy.
Manuipluated signals and data using transformation and filtering techniques.
Apply the probabilistic theory of noise and the mathematical theory of
detection/estimation to data analysis tasks encountered in astronomy.
Solve computational challenges encountered in real applications using advanced optimization methods.
Understand some advanced methods in computational statistics (machine learning).

Lab 2: Generate Sinousidal Signal and create a plot.  
Lab 4: Generate 5 and 1/2 signal Nqyuist Frequency. 
Lab 5: Generate 3 sinusoids at different frequencies, add them, filter each, then perform FFT and compare plots of original vs filtered signal periodograms.
Lab 6: Adding Spectrogram to my signal testgensinusig.m
